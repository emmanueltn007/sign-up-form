## This project challenged me to:

## Build a responsive landing page (desktop + mobile) with a sign-up form, based on provided design assets.

## Implement layout, styling and interactive behaviour so that the form:

   -displays correctly on different screen sizes

   -shows hover and focus states for interactive elements

   -validates user input when submitted: error if any input is empty, or if email is not correctly formatted.

   -Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the client-side validation.

## 🚀 What I Learned / Key Skills

## Through building this challenge, I improved on the following:

    - Responsive Layout: I practised using media queries, flexible units (%, em, rem), and CSS layout techniques (Flexbox / Grid) to make the design adapt from mobile to desktop.

    - Styling Details: I paid attention to the design’s style guide (fonts, colours, spacing, hover/focus states) and replicated them as closely as possible.

    - Client-Side Form Validation: I wrote JavaScript to check form inputs before submission:

    - Verified that no required fields are left blank

    - Checked that the email input matches a valid format (using regex or HTML5 validation)

    - Displayed error messages and styled them appropriately (red text, icons, etc)

    - User Experience: I worked on the UX of the form: clear error feedback, accessible focus states, intuitive layout.

    - Code Organisation & Readability: I kept my HTML semantic, separated styles into meaningful sections, and structured JavaScript so that validation logic is clear and reusable.

    - Attention to Detail: Matching the design exactly (pixel spacing, font weights, colours) sharpened my eye for small but important details.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

  - HTML5

  - CSS3 (with responsive breakpoints, Flexbox/Grid)

  - JavaScript (ES6+) for client-side validation

  - Design assets from Frontend Mentor: style-guide, mobile/desktop previews.
